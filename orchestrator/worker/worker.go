//1. Run tasks as Docker containers.
//2. Accept tasks to run from a manager.
//3. Provide relevant statistics to the manager for the purpose of scheduling
//tasks.
//4. Keep track of its tasks and their state.

// WORKER
// Name is the name of the worker.
// Queue holds tasks in a FIFO order.
// Db is a map that associates task UUIDs with their corresponding tasks.
// TaskCount tracks the number of tasks the worker is currently managing.
// mu is a mutex to ensure thread-safe operations on the worker's fields.
